Olympus Twin Peaks — Project Report
Well we rushed through the problem statement because we started late 

 **Overview :-**

This repository contains our approach and solution for the Olympus Twin Peaks problem statement.
Our work focused on two main tasks — handling FITS astronomical image data and cleaning a corrupted passenger dataset using Python.

 **Task 1: FITS File Analysis** 
 
 Approach:-


Initially explored FITS file handling through provided references and external resources.

Used Python (with relevant libraries such as astropy, matplotlib, etc.) to load, plot, and visualize the FITS images.

Applied suitable color gradients to improve the visual clarity of the images.

Identified and verified each image using:

nova.astronomy.net

Google image search

Provided short descriptions for each anomaly or interesting feature observed in the images.

 **Task 2: Data Cleaning and Restoration**

 Objective:-
 

Clean and restore a dataset containing corrupted passenger data, where some records had missing or incorrect values.

 Approach:-

Initially struggled to interpret the task but clarified it using documentation and tutorials.

Utilized Python’s pandas library to manage, clean, and analyze the dataset.

Handled:

Missing values (NaN or blank fields)

Invalid or corrupted entries

Implemented both provided functions and custom functions (referenced from online documentation) to repair and restore the dataset.

Verified that the cleaned dataset aligns with the expected data structure and requirements.

** Tools & Technologies:-**

Python

Astropy (for FITS file handling)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Pandas (for data management)

nova.astronomy.net (for image identification) 

Google & AI tools (for cross-verification)

 **Team:-**

Developed collaboratively by **A.Haseebb** and **V.Aarush**
